<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
I hold a BSc in Meteorology and Hydrology and an MSc in Climate Change and Development. I currently work as a lecturer and researcher at the Faculty of Meteorology and Hydrology, Arba Minch University, Ethiopia. 
</p>
  
<p>
I have taught a variety of meteorological courses, including Atmospheric Dynamics, Aviation Meteorology, Earth System Science, and other related subjects. 
</p>
  
<p>
This teaching experience has provided me with a solid understanding of the equations governing atmospheric motion, such as the Navier–Stokes equations, as well as atmospheric boundary layer phenomena and micrometeorological processes that are critical for safe and efficient flight operations.
<p>
  
<p>
My academic interests include atmospheric boundary-layer processes, urban wind dynamics, turbulence, and their implications for weather-robust and safe Advanced Air Mobility operations.
</p>

<p>
I am preparing for PhD applications in topics related to micrometeorology, urban CFD, and AAM.
