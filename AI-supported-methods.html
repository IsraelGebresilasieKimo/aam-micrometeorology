    AI-supported methods for spatiotemporal prediction of microclimatic conditions

  <div class="content">

    <p>
High-fidelity CFD (LES) is computationally challenging and commonly requires
hours to days to complete a single simulation, despite its high accuracy.
Moreover, the urban microclimate is nonlinear and highly variable in space and
time, and is strongly influenced by buildings, surrounding weather conditions,
and UAV motion. It is therefore impractical to run LES in real time for every
UAV flight.
    </p>

    <p>
By identifying patterns in high-quality data sources such as LES simulations, 3D Doppler-LIDAR measurements, 
and ultrasonic anemometer observations, artificial intelligence (AI) significantly aids in overcoming this constraint. 
These datasets are used to develop rapid prediction capabilities, train AI models, and define safety-relevant targets.
    </p>

    <p>
Almost real-time risk assessment and operational decision support are
made possible by AI models' rapid microclimatic hazard forecasting after training.
    </p>

    <p>
In order to support go/no-go decisions, flight corridor planning, and the establishment of risk envelopes for UAV operations
the generated predictions can subsequently be incorporated into safety cases and digital-twin frameworks.
    </p>

    <p>
In conclusion, measurements and high-fidelity CFD offer precise but computationally costly information on urban turbulence. 
Real-time risk assessment and safer UAV operations within a digital-twin framework are 
made possible by AI-supported techniques that can learn from these data to provide quick spatiotemporal predictions of microclimatic hazards.
