<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>
I am Israel Gebresilasie Kimo, a lecturer and researcher in meteorology and
hydrology with research interests in urban microclimate, wind–structure
interaction, and Advanced Air Mobility (AAM).
</p>

<p>
My work focuses on understanding how urban wind fields, turbulence, and
pressure distributions influence low-altitude aerial operations such as
eVTOLs and unmanned aerial systems. I use computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
tools, including RWIND, to analyze micro-scale flow behavior around complex
urban structures.
</p>

<p>
This website presents my ongoing practice, simulations, and reflections
related to AAM safety, urban aerodynamics, and atmospheric flow modeling.
